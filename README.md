### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Theo Borten. 
Currently I'm at FEA.dev, a group of studies of programming and business from USP (Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo).

I'm looking forward to learning more of Python, SQL, A.I, Q.F, and much more.

As you can see, I'm not realy used to use GIT or GITHUB. Sorry for the lack of cool functions and API's that would make this read.me pretty.
